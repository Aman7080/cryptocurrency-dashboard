<h1 align="center">Cryptocurrency Dashboard</h1>

A crypto dashboard is a digital platform that lives on a website or an app (either desktop or mobile). Its primary function is to track your cryptocurrency coins and monitor their historical prices and current values so that you can manage both your crypto assets and related financial plans accordingly. The dashboard integrates with cryptocurrency exchanges or trackers like CoinMarketCap through an API or other tool to update your crypto assets in real-time.

This is a cryptocurrency dashboard app built using **React 18**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React-redux**, **Redux-thunk**, **React-chartjs-2** and **Chart.js 3**. The app uses the **CoinGecko API** to get cryptocurrency data such as live prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, historical data, crypto categories, images, and more.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
